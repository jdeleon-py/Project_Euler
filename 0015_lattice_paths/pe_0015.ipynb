    "<p>Starting with a $1 \\times 1$ grid, there are only two possible paths to follow to reach the bottom right corner from the top left corner. Note that for each path $n$, there are $2n$ moves to make to reach the desired location on the grid; as such, for a $1 \\times 1$ grid, two moves can reach the desired location. Expanding the grid to a $2 \\times 1$ (or symmetrically a $1 \\times 2$) grid, there is only one additional path to follow from the $1 \\times 1$ case, thus providing a total of 3 paths. Expanding further, it is provided that a $2 \\times 2$ grid gives a total of 6 possible paths.</p>\n",
    "<p>For the more astute of mathematical observers the punchline may be clear, but for the sake of clarity, it can be seen that a $1 \\times 3$ (or $3 \\times 1$) grid provides a total of 4 paths to follow, and a $1 \\times 4$ (or $4 \\times 1$) grid provides a total of 5 paths to follow. It can be safe to assume now that for any $1 \\times n$, (or $n \\times 1$) grid, there exist a total of $n + 1$ paths. Likewise, expanding to a $2 \\times 3$ (or $3 \\times 2$) grid can produce a total of 10 possible paths.</p>\n",
