'''
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10)^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of 
the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is,
3025âˆ’385=2640

Find the difference between the sum of the squares 
of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
